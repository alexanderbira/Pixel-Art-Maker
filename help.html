<p>This is the default tool, and will be selected if any other tool is deselected. Allows you to draw freely by clicking a pixel, or dragging while with the mouse down.<br> <kbd>alt+space</kbd><br> <embed src="icons/pen.png?raw=true" /></p>

<p>Opens up a draggable widget where you can create and delete colour circles. These colour circles are automatically saved between sessions, and any of them can be selected to change the brush colour to its colour. The colour of these circles can be changed either through your computer's native colour selector, through typing in a CSS colour code, or with the RGBAHSL sliders/text boxes.<br> <kbd>alt+c</kbd><br> <embed src="icons/palette.png?raw=true" /></p>
